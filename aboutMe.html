With each obstacle I overcome, I become even more committed to my mission. Whether it's facing treacherous dungeons, outsmarting cunning enemies, or enduring long and perilous journeys, I never give up. My unbreakable spirit and the support of my loyal friends give me the strength to continue fighting, knowing that the fate of our kingdom rests on my shoulders.

              <h3 class="start-header">How I Got Started</h3>
              <p class="start-paragraph">
                My journey as a hero began when I first stumbled upon the Mushroom Kingdom. I was an ordinary plumber, going about my daily business when I discovered a hidden portal that transported me to a world unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was in this fantastical realm that I met Princess Peach, a noble and kind-hearted ruler who was in dire need of rescue. Without hesitation, I took on the mantle of a hero and set out on a quest to save her from the clutches of the villainous Bowser. Along the way, I encountered magical creatures, faced challenging trials, and formed lifelong friendships with loyal allies. Each adventure became a stepping stone, shaping me into the hero I am today. It was a combination of courage, determination, and a deep sense of justice that fueled my journey and led me to become the legendary hero known as Mario.
